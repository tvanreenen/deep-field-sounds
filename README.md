# Deep Field Sounds

An experimental sound synthesis project exploring the intersection of mathematics, code, and AI.

## Project Setup

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management and virtual environments. You can run the scripts directly using `uv run` without needing to install dependencies manually.

## üé® Colored Noise Generator

The colored noise generator creates a spectrum of noise types with different frequency characteristics, from bright white noise to deep brown noise.

### What is Colored Noise?

Colored noise refers to random signals with specific power spectral density characteristics. The "color" refers to how the power is distributed across frequencies:

- **White Noise (Œ±=0.0)**: Equal power at all frequencies
- **Pink Noise (Œ±=1.0)**: Equal power per octave (1/f)
- **Brown Noise (Œ±=2.0)**: Power increases with decreasing frequency (1/f¬≤)

Between these primary colors, we've created intermediate colors:
- **Silver Noise (Œ±=0.3)**: Between white and pink
- **Pearl Noise (Œ±=0.6)**: Closer to pink than white
- **Coral Noise (Œ±=1.3)**: Between pink and brown
- **Copper Noise (Œ±=1.6)**: Closer to brown than pink

### Understanding Frequency Distribution

In audio, an octave is a doubling of frequency. For example:
- 20 Hz to 40 Hz is one octave
- 40 Hz to 80 Hz is another octave
- 80 Hz to 160 Hz is another octave

Different colored noises distribute power across these octaves in distinct ways:

#### White Noise (Œ±=0.0)
- Has equal power at each individual frequency
- The power at 20 Hz equals the power at 40 Hz equals the power at 80 Hz
- However, since there are twice as many frequencies in each higher octave, the total power in each octave doubles as frequency increases
- This makes white noise sound very bright and harsh
- Mathematical relationship: Power(f) = constant

#### Pink Noise (Œ±=1.0)
- Has equal total power in each octave
- The power in the 20-40 Hz octave equals the power in the 40-80 Hz octave equals the power in the 80-160 Hz octave
- To achieve this, the power at individual frequencies must decrease as frequency increases
- This matches how human hearing perceives sound (roughly logarithmic)
- Mathematical relationship: Power(f) = constant / f
- Often described as "1/f noise" - power is inversely proportional to frequency

#### Brown Noise (Œ±=2.0)
- Power increases with decreasing frequency
- Has even more low-frequency content than pink noise
- Creates a deep, rumbling sound
- Mathematical relationship: Power(f) = constant / f¬≤

### How the Script Works

The generator uses a sophisticated approach to create colored noise:

1. **Start with White Noise**: Generate random samples in the time domain
2. **Transform to Frequency Domain**: Use FFT to get the frequency spectrum
3. **Apply Power Law Scaling**: Modify the spectrum according to the desired color
4. **Transform Back to Time Domain**: Use inverse FFT to get the final signal
5. **Normalize for Consistent Volume**: Ensure all colors have similar perceived loudness

### Power Law Scaling Formula

For colors with Œ± > 1.0 (pink to brown), we use a non-linear scaling formula to gradually reduce the effective alpha for darker colors (> 1.0) to prevent them from becoming too quiet:

```
effective_alpha = alpha * (1.0 - 0.25 * (alpha - 1.0))
```

Example scaling:
```
Original Œ±    Effective Œ±    Result
0.0  ‚Üí  0.0  (white noise - unchanged)
0.3  ‚Üí  0.3  (silver noise - unchanged)
0.6  ‚Üí  0.6  (pearl noise - unchanged)
1.0  ‚Üí  1.0  (pink noise - unchanged)
1.3  ‚Üí  1.23 (coral noise - slightly reduced)
1.6  ‚Üí  1.45 (copper noise - moderately reduced)
2.0  ‚Üí  1.5  (brown noise - significantly reduced)
```

### Interpreting Debug Output

The script includes debug print statements that help you understand what's happening at each stage of the noise generation process. Here's how to interpret them:

```
Generating pink noise (Œ±=1.0):
Spectrum magnitude range: 1.23e-01 to 2.45e+00
Signal range before normalization: -3.45e+00 to 3.67e+00
Current RMS before normalization: 1.23e+00
Final signal range: -8.12e-01 to 8.34e-01
Final RMS: 1.00e-01
Scaled int16 range: -26623 to 27341
```

#### What Each Line Means:

1. **Spectrum magnitude range**: Shows the range of values in the frequency domain after applying the power law scaling. Higher values indicate more power in certain frequency bands.

2. **Signal range before normalization**: Shows the min/max values of the time-domain signal before any normalization. These values can vary widely depending on the noise color.

3. **Current RMS before normalization**: The Root Mean Square value of the signal before normalization. RMS is a measure of the average power of the signal.

4. **Final signal range**: The min/max values after normalization. These should be between -1.0 and 1.0, with values closer to ¬±1.0 indicating a more dynamic signal.

5. **Final RMS**: The target RMS value (0.1) that all signals are normalized to for consistent volume.

6. **Scaled int16 range**: The final values scaled to 16-bit PCM format (range: -32768 to 32767). Values closer to ¬±32767 indicate a louder signal.

#### What to Look For:

- **White noise** typically has a wider spectrum magnitude range and more uniform distribution.
- **Pink noise** shows a gradual decrease in spectrum magnitude as frequency increases.
- **Brown noise** shows a steeper decrease in spectrum magnitude, with most power concentrated in lower frequencies.
- If the **Final RMS** is significantly lower than 0.1, the signal might be too quiet.
- If the **Scaled int16 range** doesn't approach ¬±32767, the signal might be too quiet.

## üß† Binaural Beats

Binaural beats are an auditory illusion perceived when two slightly different frequencies are played separately in each ear. The brain interprets the difference as a rhythmic "beat," which may influence brainwave activity.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Headphones are required** to experience the intended effect.

### How It Works

This script generates seamlessly loopable binaural beats:
- üéµ A left ear tone at a base frequency
- üéµ A right ear tone at base + beat frequency
- üîÑ Seamlessly loopable audio with no audible transitions
- üß™ Output as a stereo `.wav` file, normalized and ready for extended listening

### Signal Processing and Loopable Design

The binaural beat generator uses sophisticated signal processing techniques to create high-quality, seamlessly loopable beats:

1. **Pure Sine Wave Generation**: Creates clean, precise frequencies for optimal beat perception
2. **Period Alignment**: Ensures the duration is a multiple of the beat frequency period for perfect looping
3. **Phase Shift**: A phase shift of œÄ (180 degrees) is added to the right channel.
   - This causes the two sine waves to start perfectly out of phase, resulting in maximum destructive interference (the quietest point) at the beginning.
   - Because the duration is aligned with the beat period, the amplitude envelope also ends at its minimum.
   - This is crucial for seamless looping without a sudden jump in loudness at the loop point.
   - Importantly, this *only* affects the starting phase of the amplitude envelope (the beat's loudness cycle); it does **not** change the frequencies of the tones sent to each ear, so the perceived beat frequency remains the same.
4. **RMS Normalization**: Ensures consistent volume levels across different frequencies
5. **Clipping Prevention**: Safeguards against audio distortion

### Benefits of Loopable Design

The loopable design, achieved through period alignment and phase shifting, provides several important advantages:

- **No Audible Loop Points**: The transition between loops is smooth and imperceptible both in waveform and amplitude envelope.
- **Extended Listening**: Perfect for meditation, sleep, or focus sessions that require extended playback
- **Consistent Experience**: Maintains the same brainwave entrainment effect throughout the session
- **Professional Quality**: Creates a polished, professional sound suitable for content creation

### Interpreting Debug Output

The script includes detailed debug information to help you understand the signal processing:

```
Generating binaural beat with base frequency 200Hz and beat frequency 10Hz:
Adjusted duration to 5.00s to align with beat period (0.10s)
Left channel range before normalization: -1.00e+00 to 1.00e+00
Right channel range before normalization: -1.00e+00 to 1.00e+00
Left channel RMS before normalization: 7.07e-01
Right channel RMS before normalization: 7.07e-01
Final stereo signal range: -1.00e+00 to 1.00e+00
Final left channel RMS: 1.00e-01
Final right channel RMS: 1.00e-01
Scaled int16 range: -32767 to 32767
```

#### What Each Line Means:

1. **Adjusted duration**: Shows the duration adjusted to align with the beat period
2. **Channel ranges**: Shows the min/max values of each channel before normalization
3. **Channel RMS**: The Root Mean Square value of each channel before normalization
4. **Final stereo range**: The min/max values after normalization
5. **Final channel RMS**: The target RMS value (0.1) that all channels are normalized to
6. **Scaled int16 range**: The final values scaled to 16-bit PCM format

#### What to Look For:

- **Adjusted duration** should be close to your requested duration, with small adjustments to align with the beat period
- **Channel ranges** should be close to ¬±1.0 before normalization, indicating proper sine wave generation
- **Channel RMS** values should be approximately 0.707 (‚àö2/2) for pure sine waves before normalization
- **Final stereo range** should be between -1.0 and 1.0, with values closer to ¬±1.0 indicating a more dynamic signal
- **Final channel RMS** should be close to 0.1, indicating proper normalization
- **Scaled int16 range** should approach ¬±32767, indicating good use of the available dynamic range

### Brainwave States

| Beat Frequency | Brainwave | Effect |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| 0.5 ‚Äì 4 Hz     | Delta     | Deep sleep, unconscious states üí§ |
| 4 ‚Äì 8 Hz       | Theta     | Meditation, lucid dreaming üåô |
| 8 ‚Äì 12 Hz      | Alpha     | Relaxation, stress relief üå§Ô∏è |
| 12 ‚Äì 30 Hz     | Beta      | Alertness, focus ‚ö° |
| 30 ‚Äì 100 Hz    | Gamma     | High-level cognition üß† |

### Frequency Selection Guide

For optimal results, consider these base frequency recommendations:

- **Delta (0.5-4 Hz)**: Use a lower base frequency (100 Hz) for a deeper, more soothing tone
- **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Slightly higher base frequency (150 Hz) maintains clarity while staying gentle
- **Alpha (8-12 Hz)**: Medium base frequency (200 Hz) balances presence and comfort
- **Beta (12-30 Hz)**: Higher base frequency (250 Hz) increases alertness while remaining pleasant
- **Gamma (30-100 Hz)**: Highest base frequency (300 Hz) promotes heightened awareness

### Customization Options

The script allows customization of several parameters:

- **Base Frequency**: The fundamental tone (typically 100-300 Hz)
- **Beat Frequency**: The difference between channels (determines brainwave state)
- **Duration**: Length of the audio file in seconds (will be adjusted to align with beat period)
- **Crossfade Duration**: Length of the fade-in and fade-out (default: 0.1 seconds)
- **Sample Rate**: Audio quality setting (default: 44.1 kHz)
